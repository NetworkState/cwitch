FAQ

1. Is this open source?

	No.  While we provide source code for your review, we neither use open source software nor release this as open source.  Unfortunately, open source is being abused by companies like Amaazon who build proprietary software on top of open source, we believe open source is meant to be used by other open source software.

2. What is your license model?

	Currently, we plan to provide license for sponsors.  Our licensing model will evolve with this project.
